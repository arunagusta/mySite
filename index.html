    <h4>The following four Vedas are the most important and the ancient Vedic Granth:-</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rig Veda (Rig; Rik; Rg; Rug; Rk; Richah Veda)</li>
        <li>Yajur Veda (Yajur; Yaju; Yajuh; Veda)</li>
        <li>Sam Veda (Sam; Saam; Saamaani Veda)</li>
        <li>Atharva Veda (Atharva; Atharv; Athrv; Chanddashi; Aangirash Veda)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Books and Teachings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ॐRigVedaॐ</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Rigveda or Rig Veda is an ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns. It is one of the four sacred canonical texts of Hinduism known as the Vedas. The Rigveda is the oldest known Vedic Sanskrit text. Its early layers are
                one of the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language</li>
            <li>Rig Veda's main theme is basic knowledge covering a wide range of topics as concepts, qualities and characteristics of God, soul and Prakriti (the primary source of nature). It also covers the properties of the visible and invisible
                world, and some basic aspects of physical sciences as chemistry, physics, mathematics, astronomy, cosmology, etc.</li>
            <li>It also contains human ideals and principles to be adopted in all walks of life. In words of Sayana, Rig veda contains nature, properties and activitiesof all types of materials, i.e., physical, metaphysics and spiritual.</li>
            <li>Rig Veda is the largest veda in terms of language content. It has 10 Mandals; 1028 Suktas; and 10581 Rik Mantras. In the last century, many books have been published on Rigved including the Mool (main sanskrit text), Bhashya
                (translations), Teeka (commentary) and Vyakhya (descriptions) on the whole or part of the Veda.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>ॐYajurVedaॐ</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Yajurveda is the Veda primarily of prose mantras for worship rituals. An ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, it is a compilation of ritual-offering formulas that were said by a priest while an individual performed ritual actions such as
                those before the yajna fire.</li>
            <li>YajurVeda mainly deals with mode of conduct, human psychology, activity and ways and means for infinite improvement in order to achieve the highest goal of life (Moksha). It emphasises how to convert knowledge gained into useful
                activities and impart the same to other human beings.</li>
            <li>Yajur Veda is the second of the four vedas. It has 40 Adhyayas and 1975 Yaju Mantras (Kandikayein). Unlike Rig Veda, Yajur Veda is more prodo-poetry which are called 'kandikayein'.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>ॐSamVedaॐ</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Samaveda, is the Veda of melodies and chants. It is an ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, and part of the scriptures of Hinduism. One of the four Vedas, it is a liturgical text which consists of 1,549 verses. All but 75 verses have been
                taken from the Rigveda.</li>
            <li>SamVeda mainly deals with that knowledge and activity by which the soul of human being is relieved from the cycle of life and death. It is devoted to the adoration, praise and worship of God; manifestations of his powers; and mode of
                worship for spiritual attainments.</li>
            <li>It emphasises for human beings to develop their mental and spiritual powers to their highest order.</li>
            <li>Sam Veda is the third Veda and the shortest in terms of the count of the Mantras. It has two shirshaks viz., Purvachik and Uttarachik and has 1874 Mantras in total.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>ॐAtharvaVedaॐ</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Atharva Veda is the "knowledge storehouse of atharvāṇas, the procedures for everyday life". The text is the fourth Veda, but has been a late addition to the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism. The language of the Atharvaveda is
                different from Vedic Sanskrit, preserving pre-Vedic Indo-European archaisms</li>
            <li>Atharva is one of the highly misinterpreted Vedic Granth. Many of the knowledgeable people (including Saayan, Griffith, etc) has mis-interpreted it to be of the Veda of Magic/Voodoism. There is nothing in the Vedas, including Atharva
                Veda that is opposed to the sciences and logic and Atharv Ved do not constitute Magic / Voodoism. Atharv Veda is infact an encyclopedia of many sciences including the medicine and chemical sciences.</li>
            <li>Atharv Ved is the last of the four Vedas. It is also known by the names BrahmVeda (owing to its description on oneness of God), ChhandoVeda (being the giver of Aanand) and Atharvaangirash Veda (as it was acquired by Rishi Angiraa). It
                has 20 Kandas, 111 Anuvaak, 731 Sukta and 5977 Mantras.</li>
